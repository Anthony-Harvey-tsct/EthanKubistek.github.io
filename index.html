         <h3>“While it is always best to believe in one's self, a little help 
        from others can be a great blessing.” - Iroh</h3>
        
        <p>This is one of my favorite quotes, it's from the animated series Avatar: The 
            Last Airbender and this quote is said by Zuko's uncle Iroh voiced by Mako Iwamatsu 
            in season 1-2 and also voiced by Greg Baldwin in season 3. One day I would like to have 
            my own quote that will inspire people and make them think about what it means to them.</p>
