        <p>“While it is always best to believe in one's self, a little help 
        from others can be a great blessing.” - Iroh</p>
        <p>This is one of my favorite quotes its from the animated series Avatar: The 
            Last Airbender and this quote is said by Zuko's uncle Iroh voiced by Mako Iwamatsu 
            in season 1-2 and alos voiced by Greg Baldwin in season 3. From inspiratinal, to funny, to romanctic and, serious
            there are tons of quotes by tons of people. One dat I would like to have 
        my own quote. </p>

        <p>I love listening to music in my spare time or when I'm working or 
            just want to relax. I have no set genre, I kinda bounce 
            back-and-forth between music all the time. I like all types of 
            differnt kinds of music. I can listen to almost anything. 
            This is my playlist of over 930 songs around 60 hours of music.
